What Happens When You Type "https://www.google.com" in Your Browser?

When you type https://www.google.com and press Enter, a bunch of things happen really fast to get you to the Google homepage.

Here’s a simple breakdown:
1. DNS Request: Finding the IP Address
First, your browser needs to figure out where www.google.com is located on the internet. It asks a DNS server to convert the domain name into an IP address, like 172.217.4.46.

2. TCP/IP Connection
Once the browser has the IP address, it uses TCP/IP to establish a connection with Google's server, ensuring that data can be sent and received properly.

3. Firewall Protection
A firewall checks the request on both your end and Google's end to make sure the connection is safe and secure from any threats.

4. HTTPS/SSL Encryption
Since the address starts with https://, the connection is encrypted using SSL/TLS, meaning any data sent (like your search queries) is protected from hackers.

5. Load Balancer
Google uses a load balancer to send your request to one of their servers that isn’t too busy, helping to keep everything fast and responsive.

6. Web Server
The web server handles the basic request, like sending the HTML, CSS, and images that make up the Google homepage.

7. Application Server
If the page needs dynamic content (like your personalized Google homepage or search results), the application server runs the code to generate and send that data.

8. Database
Google’s database stores lots of data, like your search history or the results you see when you search. The application server asks the database for the relevant information.

So, every time you visit Google, a bunch of steps happen in the background, including DNS lookups, secure connections, traffic management, and data retrieval, all to make sure you get the Google homepage in just a few seconds!
